This is a new file created to test out git, which I've just downloaded separately from the Eclipse version. I was forced into using that for the project in CS350, Software Engineering,
with only instructions on how to install git in Eclipse, but nothing about how to use it.

Here's an addition to this file, so that git can see the change, and I can understand a little more about committing.
